# BlackfinPlus

This Ghidra plugin adds support for the Blackfin+ architecture.  

## Limitations

For the time being, parallel instructions are not handled.

## A word of caution

This is currently in an untested state and thus most likely contains a few errors.  
Though, as we need this extension for one of our other project, we'll progressively patch
these as we encounter them.
That being said, if you stumble upon one please notify us.
